## Presentation

**PREESM** is an **open source rapid prototyping tool**. It simulates signal processing applications and generates code for **heterogeneous multi/many-core embedded systems**. Its dataflow language eases the description of parallel signal processing applications.

The PREESM tool inputs are an **algorithm graph**, an **architecture graph**, and a **scenario** which is a set of parameters and constraints that specify the conditions under which the deployment will run. The chosen type of algorithm graph is a parameterized and hierarchical extension of Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) graphs named PiSDF. The architecture graph is named System-Level Architecture Model (S-LAM). From these inputs, **PREESM maps and schedules automatically** the code over the multiple processing elements and generates multi-core code.

## Installation

Instructions for installing Preesm can be found in the [documentation](/docs/). Preesm consists in Eclipse plug-ins. If you are already familiar with Eclipse update sites, the different ways for getting Preesm are detailed in the [Getting Preesm](/get/) part.
